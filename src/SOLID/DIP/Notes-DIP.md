# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The **Dependency Inversion Principle** states that:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

In simple terms:

- High-level classes (that handle business logic) should not directly depend on low-level classes (that handle
  implementation details).
- Instead, both should depend on an interface or abstract class.
