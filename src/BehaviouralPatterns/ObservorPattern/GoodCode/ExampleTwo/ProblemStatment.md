Stock Price Monitoring System Application Exercise
You are developing a stock price monitoring system that implements the Observer Design Pattern to notify investors (
observers) whenever there is a significant change in stock prices (subject). The system should allow multiple investors
to track different stocks and get notified about price fluctuations.

Requirements:

Subject (Stock Market):

The stock market should maintain a list of observers (investors).

It should have methods to register, remove, and notify observers.

The setStockPrice method should update the stock price for a specific stock and notify all registered observers only if
the price change exceeds a predefined threshold.

Observers:

Create two observer classes (e.g., InvestorA and InvestorB) that implement a common Observer interface.

Each observer should implement an update method to receive notifications about stock price changes

Data Representation:

Each stock can have attributes like stock symbol, current price, and a threshold for notification (e.g., a percentage
change).

Output:

The program will register two observers (InvestorA and InvestorB).

It will notify both observers of significant stock price changes that exceed the predefined threshold.

If an observer is removed, they will no longer receive notifications for subsequent price changes.

The output will confirm which investors received notifications, showcasing the observer design pattern in action.

Instructions:

You only need to complete the TODOs mentioned in the code.

Please do not modify any existing code outside of the specified TODO sections.
